## DOES NOT WORK CURRENTLY - Weather.com stopped allowing web scrapers to get data. Working on a new version with API support and GUI

# Python Weather API - Peter Steele
This is a hobby project of mine to create a python program that can scrape a weather site and output the current weather, 10 day forecasts, etc. I realize I could simply just go to the websites for this information but where is the fun in that? 

My main goals with this project are to create a class that handles the logic and scraping, while a GUI interface that sits on the desktop queries the proper information and displays it for you. Again, nothing unique here, but I am not going off any other projects similar to this, and I am writing this from the ground up to help myself learn and gain more experience with Python. 

Hopefully you all find this project fun and interesting and can make it something even greater! I'm uploading the 
code under GNUv3 so have at it. If you have any questions or suggestions for a different route I might take then 
please message me at info@pbsteele.com.

# Installation
To install this program, it is rather simple. You will need two modules for python and that's it! I use the requests and BeautifulSoup modules to get the html and parse it for the weather data needed. 

**1.)** To install requests simply run the command:
```pip install requests```

**2.)** To install BeautifulSoup simply run the command:
```pip install bs4```

**3.)** Lastly, download or clone this repo and use the class in any project you might be working on currently. You can also play around with it and just import the class into a blank python file and create as many objects as you want and run the code to output the desired weather. I will be working on a GUI later on that will simplify this even further. 

# Example's
Here I will provide and example of how to currently use the program to get weather information. Use this information 
to build your own weather app! You can also run the Weather_API_DEMO.py file to see it in action as well. Simply just change the zipcode for the location you wish to view and run it. You will see the updated information. You may change the Object name if you wish as well. 

**Today's Weather**
```
sault = Weather('49783')
sault.scrape()
sault.find_todays_conditions()
print(sault.location_name)
print(sault.todays_high())
print(sault.todays_low())
print(sault.todays_feels_like())
print(sault.todays_wind())
print(sault.todays_description())
print(sault.todays_dew_point())
print(sault.todays_humidity())
print(sault.todays_pressure())
print(sault.todays_visibility())
print(sault.todays_precipitation())
print(sault.todays_short_description())
print(sault.todays_sunrise())
print(sault.todays_sunset())
print(sault.request_time())
```
**Expected Output**

9:01 pm                                         # Todays Sunset
as of 3:02 am EDT                               # Time that website was scraped
```
So basically I have split this up into several different methods. The reason behind this so far, is that 
I want as much modularity as possible for now regarding finding the temps, formatting and printing the temps, 
scraping the site for the temps, etc. This may change in the future as I update the program and add more features. I will reflect these changes here in the README as necessary.

This API, while not difficult or overly complex, can be incorporated into a multitude of projects. From GUI based weather applications to console based apps. Use it however you like! I have done the dirty work of digging through the HTML and extracting the relevant information. Now it is up to you to utilize this however you see fit! I really hope you enjoy this project, and I will be working on creating more features soon. I want to add extended forecasts, weekend forecasts, and so much more. 

# Conclusion
Thank you all for checking out my repo and app. This is very much a work in progress and new features and 
restructuring are done often. As mentioned above, if you have any questions, comments, or concerns, please don't 
hesitate to contact me at info@pbsteele.com and I will be more than happy to read and reply to those messages.
